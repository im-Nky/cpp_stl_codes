# Use Sequential containers when you need to access element by position.

# Use vectors as default sequential container intead of array.

# If situation demands add (or) remove from both end frequently use "deque".

# Priority queues are a type of container adapters, specifically designed 
such that the "first element" of the queue is the "greatest" of all elements in
the queue and elements are in non increasing order(hence we can see that each
element of the queue has a priority{fixed order}).

# use list(not deque) when element need to insert  in middle of sequence.

# Don't use list if random access is required.

# Prefer vector over list if your system uses cache b/c memory isn't stored 
continously increases chance of missing cache significantly.(embedded system don't
utiliza cache so list is acceptable.)

# for key/value pair default to unordered map , or if order matters use map.

# If you need multiple enteries for same key use unordered_multimap (or) order matters 
use multimap.

# Contnously: Vector, array & string

-> Deque allocates memory in chunks.
-> List allocates memory in nodes.
